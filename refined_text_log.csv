**Food Name Extraction Method**

**Step 1:** Extract key ingredients from the ingredients list that hint at a specific food type. In this case, two key ingredients stand out: ""Tomato Paste"" and ""Pasta"". The presence of tomato paste, along with noodles, is highly indicative of a classic Italian dish known for combining tomatoes, cheese, and pasta.

**Step 2:** Combine the extracted words with the product type from the product name ""Italian Pizza Pasta"" to get a more specific food name.

**Food Name:** Italian (from product name) + Pizza (from key ingredients and product name)

The food name of the product is **Italian Pizza**."
